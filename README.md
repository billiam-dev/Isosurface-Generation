# Isosurface Generation
Experimental project for isosurface extraction from SDFs. Features both marching cubes and surface nets generation methods, using the Unity JOBS system.
This experiment was used to build a much more efficient and faster infinite terrain generator using transvoxel for LODing and brickmaps for storage efficiency.

Built with Unity 6000.2.8f1

## Benchmarks
Around 0.6 ms per chunk of size 32^3 voxels:
- Density generation: 0.2 ms
- Marching Cubes : 0.4 ms

This was tested with a 12th Gen Intel Core I9-12900K, and is dependent on the number and size of shapes in the scene.

## Features
- Per-shape blending sharpness value.
- Realtime shape editing, additive & subtractive SDF's.
- Fast surface painting and chunk regeneration.
- Smooth normals and vertex de-duplication for optimized meshes.
- Marching Cubes and Surface Nets meshing methods.
- Optimized with Unity JOBS and SIMD instructions.
